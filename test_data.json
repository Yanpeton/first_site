The deal came shortly after the Chinese firm said in July that it would spend $195 million to increase its stake in its PC joint venture with another Japanese firm NEC Corp.\r\nJacky Zhao, an analyst at International Data Corp, said the move is the latest sign that Lenovo is trying to strengthen its top spot by teaming up with all possible partners as the PC market continues its downward trend.\r\n\"Initiating mergers is not only an effective way to survive the cold winter in the PC market. It can also give Lenovo more resources to revive its business when demand begins to pick up,\" Zhao added.\r\nIn the second quarter of 2016, worldwide PC shipments declined 4.5 percent year-on-year to 62.4 million units. Lenovo performed better than the average, with a decline of 2.3 percent and a shipments of 13.2 million units, data from IDC shows.\r\n\"Fujitsu has a good brand appeal among Japanese consumers. The deal, if it goes through, can effectively boost Lenovo's existing business there,\" Zhao said, adding that Lenovo had 19.4 percent share of the global PC market in 2015, compared with 2.1 percent for Fujitsu.When it comes to Japan, Lenovo is the largest PC vendor, accounting for about 25 percent of the market last year, according to tech consultancy Gartner Inc. It also has a R&D center there that leads the design of the ThinkPad brand, which is one of the keys to maintaining profit margins in the high-end niche.",

In addition to a premium camera and long battery life, the company is expected to use Pixel to highlight a digital assistant software called “Google Assistant.”\r\nThe software uses artificial intelligence that would create a “personal Google for each and every user,” according to Sundar Pichai, Google’s CEO.\r\nPixel is built by HTC, but Google has reportedly been in on the design, leading to the “phone by Google” branding. The phones are powered by a Snapdragon 821 processor.\r\nGoogle also said it would offer free unlimited cloud storage for all, full-resolution images and videos shot with Pixel.\r\nPixel will not be Google’s first move into the smartphone market. In the past, the company sold phones and tablets under the Nexus brand. The company did not heavily market the phones, which limited their popularity.\r\nPixel will be powered by Google’s Android operating system, which powers most of the world’s smartphones. At Tuesday’s event, the company said the phones will run on a cleaner version of Android than on other phones like the Samsung Galaxy S7. Google said the Pixel version would be faster.\r\nThe Bloomberg news service called Google’s move into the smartphone market “risky” but said it likely is spurred by the company’s desire to “ensure distribution for its web services, and more complex offerings like virtual and augmented reality.”",

            "content": "A magnified image of Pseudo-nitzschia australis. C. Wingert/Cochlan San Francisco State University\r\nTiny water plants called phytoplankton serve as food for many sea creatures, including whales, shrimp, jellyfish and snails.\r\nPhytoplankton do well in cold water. But if water temperatures rise by only two degrees Celsius, the phytoplankton struggle. That is what happened in the last three or four years in the northern part of the Pacific Ocean.\r\nResearchers say an unusual area of warm water spread throughout the Northern Pacific. Scientists called the warm water “the blob,” as if it were a character in an old science fiction movie.\r\nAt its largest, the blob stretched 1,600 square kilometers and reached depths of 91 meters.\r\nThis large mass of warm water had a damaging effect on the ocean food chain. Many fish that depend on phytoplankton swam away from the area. As a result, sea birds and sea lions that eat those fish starved.\r\nScientists from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the University of Washington have found that the warm ocean “blob” caused a harmful algae bloom. That fast growth in algae hurt fishing grounds along the U.S. West Coast and Canada’s British Columbia.\r\nThe researchers recently published their study in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.\r\nThey looked at the algae, called P. australis. The researchers found that the algae can grow much faster than normal if it is exposed to warm water.\r\nThe higher levels of algae also produced more of a poisonous chemical that can cause problems for everything from shellfish to dolphins to sea lions. It also causes problems for humans if too much of the chemical builds up in their blood.\r\nResearchers say algae blooms like this one will continue as ocean waters warm. The algae will hurt sea animals, birds, and fish. It may damage food resources for humans all over the world, the scientists say.\r\nI’m Dan Friedell.\r\nKevin Enochs wrote this story for VOANews.com.Dan Friedell adapted it for Learning English.",

Friday's Labor Department report says the economy had a net gain of 156,000 jobs.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON —\r\nThe U.S. economy had a net gain of 156,000 jobs in September, according to a report Friday from the Labor Department, which also says the unemployment rate increased slightly to 5 percent.\r\nThe jobless rate rose one-tenth of a percent because more people started looking for work, although not all of them found jobs.\r\n\r\nU.S. officials count people as officially unemployed only if they are available for work and looked for a job sometime in the past four weeks. Economists say a stronger job market encourages people to resume their hunt for work and that can push up the unemployment rate.\r\n\r\nSeptember’s job gains were lower than average so far this year; however, the data also show hourly wages rose 2.6 percent over the past year, growing slightly faster than the modest rate of inflation.\r\n\r\nThe report shows 7.9 million Americans are out of work, a number that changed little in September. Another 5.9 million people are considered “under-employed,” because are working part-time, but want full time work.\r\n\r\nA positive report on the job market tends to help the incumbent political party, which is trying to convince voters that it has done a good job managing the economy. Bad economic news could help persuade voters that it is time for a change of leadership.\r\nThis mixed report complicates the task of the U.S. central bank, which has kept interest rates at an exceptionally low level since the recession in a bid to boost economic growth. Many economists and investors expect the U.S. Federal Reserve to raise rates, slightly in December.",

That is because one in every 10 U.S. students from grades Kindergarten to 12th grade are English learners.\r\n\r\nMost English learners arrive from a country that speaks another language, or have parents from a non-English-speaking country.\r\nThere has been progress in recent years, King said. He noted Spanish-speaking students are graduating high school and attending college at higher rates than ever before.\r\n\r\n“But in too many places across the country, English learners get less -- less access to quality teachers, less access to advanced coursework, less access to the resources they need to succeed,” King said.\r\n\r\nEducation Secretary John King\r\n\r\nKing said a new federal law called the Every Student Succeeds Act can help. It allows school districts more ways to use federal money to improve programs for English learners. That includes better training for English language teachers.\r\n\r\nKelly Gonez is a policy adviser at the Department of Education.\r\n\r\nShe said research shows giving instruction in two languages, English and the student’s native language, is better for English learners.\r\n\r\nAlthough it takes them a little longer to master English, they do better on tests that measure reading and math skills, Gonez said.\r\n\r\nSo do people who enter dual-language programs already proficient in English, Gonez said. To be proficient means able to read and speak a language.",
